	v0.7.0 - SSO refcnt

	Before, taking a view of an SSO would auto-mutate it into OWN with alloc.
	Beyond the cost of this convertion, it created a fault if a VUE was active 
	on the SSO..
	Now taking a view of an SSO uses new_ssovue() which increases the new
	SSO.refcnt field and uses a non-zero VUE.off as flag and offset
